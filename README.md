## 🔍 What I Build
I build **systems**.  
Work that survives messy real data, scales across use cases, and has measurable behavior.

My focus areas:
- **AI systems** — retrieval, verification, grounding with LLMs
- **Data engineering** — pipelines, crawlers, clean APIs
- **Product engineering** — full-stack features, API integration, bug fixes

---

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🔹 Verique — LLM Claim Verification
A system that:
- Extracts factual claims from language model outputs
- Classifies each claim as **verified / not verifiable / outdated / opinion**
- Surfaces what the system *doesn’t know*, not just what it claims
- Designed for **trust and transparency** in generative systems

> Demonstrates rigorous thinking about correctness, not fluency.

---

### 🔹 VidWise-AI — YouTube RAG Assistant
A full-fledged Retrieval-Augmented Generation application that:
- Retrieves long-form data from YouTube transcripts
- Uses vector search + reranking for grounded responses
- Interfaces with users through a UI for real queries

> Practical LLM engineering — not prompt console demos.

---

### 🔹 brickbyte & BrickByte_Graphs — Real-Estate AI Insights
- **brickbyte:** Data-driven real estate modeling (Jupyter notebook)
- **BrickByte_Graphs:** Supporting visual analytics for trends and forecasting

> Combines ML insight with usable analytics.

---

### 🔹 Price_Prediction — Time-Series Forecasting
Long-horizon property price forecasting with:
- Seasonality modeling
- Trend bounds
- Stability considerations over blind accuracy

> Solid ML work showing disciplined modeling.

---

### 🔹 POLARIS — AI Risk & Analysis 
A framework exploring:
- Risk identification in AI systems
- Decision boundaries under uncertainty
- Governance-aware thinking for deployed models

> Signals systems thinking beyond raw engineering.

---

## 🛠️ Other Work
These showcase complementary skills:
- **News_Crawler** — scalable crawlers for real data
- **Human_Detection** — CV detection demo
- **tts, tts_app, model-graph, Reg, Mou_Generator, Watermark, Matchmaking** — frontend/util experiments

These are fine for breadth but **not primary signals**.

## 💼 Professional Experience

**AI Research & Development Intern — Zanista AI (UK)**  
- Built scalable news crawlers and cleaned pipelines  
- Integrated LLM models for summarization, sentiment & NER  
- Produced reliable, deduplicated datasets and APIs

**Web Developer Intern — BharatFare**  
- Production bug fixes in a live platform  
- Integrated APIs across frontend and backend  
- Worked in real TypeScript/Node.js codebases

> This shows you can ship in real teams, not just hobby projects.

---

## 💡 Tech Stack
**AI/ML:** LLMs, Retrieval, Verification  
**Data:** Crawlers, Clean Pipelines  
**ML:** Time Series, Regression  
**Engineering:** Python, SQL, TypeScript, Node.js  
**Tools:** FAISS, Streamlit, Git

---

## ⚙️ Core Principles
- **Evaluation first** — measure before claiming  
- **Uncertainty over bullshit confidence**  
- **Systems over side gigs**
